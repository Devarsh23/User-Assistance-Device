Computer vision can significantly enhance the quality of life of visually disabled people. In this area, we have been working on a wearable device, which will help the visually impaired in their daily life. Our approach relies on a custom trained object detection model, image processing techniques and raspberry pi having a camera and headphones attached. System first captures the image and uses image processing techniques on this image. Then this image is given to custom trained object detection model and output is sent via speech. The system also offers the functionality of user input through haptic feedback, as well as audio messages. Moreover, the output will be enunciated by the headphones. So, the blind person can easily understand the result of the system
